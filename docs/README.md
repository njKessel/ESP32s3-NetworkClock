# ESP32s3-NetworkClock
ESP32-S3 smart clock with LED display, weather, moon phase, temperature, Google Calendar. Work in progress.

My goal with this project is to begin with a simple clock with a simple display. This started as a LCD but eventually became a 7-segment display. Eventually I would like to add Google Calendar, weather, temperature, and other features and try to convey this information on a simple display (may move to VFD for this)
